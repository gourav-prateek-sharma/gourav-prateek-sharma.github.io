Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Division of Information Science and Engineering](https://www.kth.se/is/ise/division-of-information-science-and-engineering-1.790272) (School of EECS), working with [Prof. James Gross](https://www.kth.se/profile/jamesgr) since October 2022. 
I received my Ph.D. from [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en), Ghent University in June 2022, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Wouter Tavernier](https://woutertavernier.net/) and [Prof. Didier Colle](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en/members/didier-colle.htm). My Ph.D. [dissertation](https://gourav-prateek-sharma.github.io/files/phd_gsharma_ugent.pdf) work involved developing and analyzing optimization algorithms for efficient resource allocation in telecom and media broadcast networks.
I have done my masters in Optoelectronics and Optical communications from IIT Delhi and my bachleors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Srinagar.

My current research interests include:

* Network Function Virtualization
* Media Function Virtualization
* Time-Sensitive Networking and DetNet
* 


If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaboration opportunities, please feel free to drop me an email. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations in the above research fields.
