Hi, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [ISE](https://www.kth.se/is/ise/division-of-information-science-and-engineering-1.790272) division (School of EECS), KTH Royal Institute of Technology Sweden, working with [Prof. James Gross](https://www.kth.se/profile/jamesgr) since October 2022. 
Prior to joining KTH, I received my Ph.D. from [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en), Ghent University in June 2022, where I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Wouter Tavernier](https://woutertavernier.net/) and [Prof. Didier Colle](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en/members/didier-colle.htm). My Ph.D. [dissertation](https://gourav-prateek-sharma.github.io/files/phd_gsharma_ugent.pdf) work involved developing and analyzing optimization algorithms for efficient resource allocation in telecom and media broadcast networks.

I have done my masters in Optoelectronics and Optical communications from IIT Delhi in 2017 and bachleors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from NIT Srinagar in 2015.

## Research interests
My research is primarily in the area of Time-sensitive Networking ([TSN](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Time-Sensitive_Networking)) and Deterministic Networking ([DetNet](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Deterministic_Networking)) and its integration with wireless technologies (e.g., WiFi and 5G URLLC). In particular, I am interested in employing data-driven methods for latency characterization of RAN network for seamless integration with TSN. 
Currently, I am exploring these research topics within the context of an EU research project called [DETERMINISTIC6G](https://deterministic6g.eu/).

## Contact
If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaboration opportunities, please feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:gpsharma@kth.se). I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations in the above mentioned research areas.
