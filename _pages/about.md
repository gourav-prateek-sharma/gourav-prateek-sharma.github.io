I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Division of Information Science and Engineering (School of EECS), working with Prof. James Gross since October 2022. I received my Ph.D. from IDLab, Ghent University in Belgium, where I was supervised by Prof. Wouter Tavernier and Prof. Didier Colle. My Ph.D. dissertation work involved developing and analyzing optimization algorithms for efficient resource allocation in telecom and media broadcast networks.
